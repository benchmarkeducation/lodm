# Spiral ODM for Laravel 5.1+
Such module is intended to bring Spiral ODM component functionality into Laravel application.

Documentation for ODM Component with examples can be found on [this page](https://github.com/spiral/guide/blob/master/odm/overview.md) - WILL BE UPDATED THIS WEEK (in my drafts for now). To find how to use Documents outside of MongoDB scope check this [documentation](https://github.com/spiral/guide/blob/master/odm/standalone.md) - IN DRAFT.

You can find list of available spiral components including Templater, ORM, Storage Manager and etc [here](https://github.com/spiral/components).

## Issues
Please do not open issue tickets in this github project unless they are related to integration process. Use [Components Respository](https://github.com/spiral/components) for ODM related issues.

## Dependencies
At this moment such module depends on whole set of spiral components and their nested dependencies, however this state is kept only until every component will get it's own repository (feel free to propose your help or suggestion).
